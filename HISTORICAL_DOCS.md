# Historical Documents

This repo contains a number of session summaries, axiom-elimination plans, and progress reports.
They are preserved for context, but they are not necessarily consistent with the current compiled
Lean modules.

## Current “Source of Truth”

- Completion tracking: `CHECKLIST_ANALYTICAL_LIBRARY.md`
- Roadmap: `PLAN.md`
- Proof/build hygiene: `PROOF_STATUS.md`
- Layering/scope: `ASSUMPTIONS_AND_SCOPE.md`
- Library API entry points: `API_GUIDE.md`
- Proof navigation: `THEOREM_INDEX.md`

## Historical Artifacts (Not Normative)

Files like the following are historical and may reference axioms/sorries/counts that no longer
exist in `Chess/` or `Test/`:

- `AXIOM_*.md`
- `PHASE_*.md`
- `SESSION_*.md`
- `FINAL_SESSION_*.md`
