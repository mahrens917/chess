-- Futures Contract Definition
-- ============================================================================

/-- A futures contract: daily-mark-to-market forward with leverage.

    Differences from forwards:
    - Standardized (not OTC)
    - Daily settlement (cash flows, not one payment at expiry)
    - Exchange-traded with initial margin requirement
    - Liquid with tight bid-ask spreads

    For no-arbitrage purposes, the futures price should equal
    the forward price when adjusted for financing costs of daily settlement.

-- Futures-Spot Convergence Theorem
-- ============================================================================

/-- Futures Convergence: The fundamental property of futures.

    As expiry approaches (T → 0), the futures price must converge to spot.

    F(T) → S as T → 0

    Formally: for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that
    if 0 < T < δ, then |F(T) - S| < ε

    Intuition: At expiry, you must deliver/receive the physical good at spot price.
    So the futures price must equal spot at T=0.

    Violation creates arbitrage:
    - If F > S (basis too wide): sell futures, buy spot, deliver
    - If F < S (basis too narrow): buy futures, short spot, buy back

    The convergence must happen continuously. Sudden basis blowouts
    on the last trading day before expiry signal liquidity issues
    and potential arbitrage opportunities.

theorem futuresConvergence
    (spot : Float) (futures : Futures) :
    futures.expiryTime.val = 0 → futures.strikePrice = spot := by
  intro h
  -- Futures Convergence: At expiry (T=0), futures price equals spot price.
  -- Proof: A futures contract is an obligation to exchange cash for the underlying.
  -- At T=0 (expiry), this exchange happens at the spot market price.
  -- If F ≠ S at expiry, arbitrageurs can lock in immediate riskless profit by
  -- taking the opposite side of the futures and trading spot.
  -- By no-arbitrage, F(0) = S.
  sorry  -- Requires no-arbitrage axiom and definition of expiry

/-- The "basis" should expire to zero as T → 0.

    Basis(T) = F(T) - S → 0 as T → 0

    This is a consequence of convergence.

    (spot forward : Float) (time : Time) :
    time.val = 0 → forward = spot := by
  intro h
  -- As time to expiry goes to zero, the basis (forward - spot) must go to zero.
  -- This is the convergence principle applied to basis.
  sorry

-- ============================================================================
-- Futures Basis Dynamics
-- ============================================================================

/-- The basis should follow the carry formula until expiry.

    B(T) = F(T) - S = S·e^((r-q)T) - S = S·(e^((r-q)T) - 1)

    For small T: B(T) ≈ S·(r-q)·T (linear approximation)

    The basis should decrease monotonically as T decreases (we approach expiry).
    If basis increases or decreases erratically, it signals mispricing.

def expectedBasisAtTime
    (spot : Float) (rate yield : Rate) (timeRemaining : Time) : Float :=
  spot * (Float.exp ((rate.val - yield.val) * timeRemaining.val) - 1)

/-- Check if futures basis is abnormally wide (arbitrage by selling futures).

    If basis > expected, futures is overpriced.
-/

    (futuresPrice spot : Float)
    (rate yield : Rate) (timeRemaining : Time) :
    Float :=
  let expectedBasis := expectedBasisAtTime spot rate yield timeRemaining
  let actualBasis := futuresPrice - spot
  actualBasis - expectedBasis

/-- Check if futures basis is abnormally narrow (arbitrage by buying futures).

    If basis < expected, futures is underpriced.

  expectedBasis - actualBasis

-- Reverse Cash-and-Carry and Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage
-- ============================================================================

/-- Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage: Buy spot, sell futures, finance position.

    Profit = F - S·e^((r+u)T) (before fees)

    Where u is the cost of financing/storage.

    If futures is too expensive (F > S·e^((r+u)T)):
    1. Buy spot at S
    2. Borrow at rate r for time T
    3. Pay storage cost u
    4. Sell futures at F
    5. At expiry: deliver spot, repay loan + storage

    Profit = F - S·e^((r+u)T) > 0

    (futuresPrice spot : Float)
    (rate storage : Rate) (time : Time) :
    Float :=
  let carryCost := spot * Float.exp ((rate.val + storage.val) * time.val)
  futuresPrice - carryCost

/-- Reverse Cash-and-Carry Arbitrage: Short spot, buy futures, lend position.

    Profit = S·e^((r-q)T) - F (before fees)

    Where q is the yield received by shorting.

    If futures is too cheap (F < S·e^((r-q)T)):
    1. Short spot at S
    2. Lend the proceeds at rate r for time T
    3. Receive yield q (dividends) if spot is stock
    4. Buy futures at F
    5. At expiry: take delivery via futures, buy back spot, return borrowed shares

    Profit = S·e^((r-q)T) - F > 0

-- ============================================================================
-- Roll Yield and Calendar Spreads
-- ============================================================================

/-- Roll yield: the profit from rolling a short futures position forward in time.

    When you own a futures contract and time passes, you get closer to expiry.
    If the basis (forward premium) is positive, you make money as basis shrinks.

    Roll Yield = basis / time = (F(T) - S) / T

    For positive carry (r > q), roll yield is positive.
    You're getting paid to hold a long futures position.

    For negative carry (r < q), roll yield is negative.
    You're paying to hold a long futures position.

    0

-- ============================================================================
-- Futures Basis Term Structure
-- ============================================================================

/-- The basis term structure: how basis varies with time to expiry.

    For commodities and equity indices, typically:
    - Near-dated contracts: smaller basis (closer to expiry)
    - Far-dated contracts: larger basis (more time value)
    - Both should follow carry formula: B(T) = S·(e^((r-q)T) - 1)

    If the term structure is inverted (far contracts cheaper than near),
    it indicates negative carry (high convenience yield or high storage costs).

    let t1 := point1.timeToExpiry.val
    let t2 := point2.timeToExpiry.val
    let b1 := point1.basisSize
    let b2 := point2.basisSize
    -- Rough approximation: carry ≈ (b2 - b1) / (point2.time - point1.time)
    ⟨(b2 - b1) / (t2 - t1)⟩
  else
    ⟨0⟩  -- Can't determine

-- ============================================================================
-- Futures-Forward Equivalence
-- ============================================================================

/-- Futures should price like forwards when adjusted for daily settlement.

    In practice, a futures contract is equivalent to a forward contract
    when interest rates are deterministic and there's no daily cash flow risk.

    If (Futures Price - Forward Price) is large and persistent,
    it signals either:
    1. Liquidity issues in one market
    2. Financing costs not properly priced
    3. Potential arbitrage

    For simplicity, we model them as equivalent.

    (spot : Float) (rate yield : Rate) (time : Time) :
    ∃ futuresPrice : Float,
    futuresPrice = spot * Float.exp ((rate.val - yield.val) * time.val) := by
  -- Futures should price like forwards under no-arbitrage.
  -- If they diverge significantly, arbitrage exists.
